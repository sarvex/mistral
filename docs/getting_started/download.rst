Mistral Checkpoints
-------------------

The Mistral team has trained 5 GPT-2 Medium models and 5 GPT-2 Small models on the OpenWebText corpus and is making them available to the public.

For each model, checkpoints at 100k, 200k, and 400k steps are provided.

Internally we have stored over 600 checkpoints for each model. If you are interested in acquiring additional checkpoints, please contact Laurel (lorr1) or Sidd (skaramcheti) at their @stanford.edu addresses.

Links to the checkpoints are in the table below.
